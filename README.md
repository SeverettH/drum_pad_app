"Weekend Projects"
"Drum Pad App"

Objective:  
            Continue to familiarize myself with HTML/CSS/Js syntax & structure through
            simple projects.

            This "Drum Pad" offers the user the ability to click on each of the 6 pads
            displayed as various colored boxes at the bottom of the page. Each has an
            associated sound which will play as the user selects(clicks) each, the user
            is able to layer sounds, as they will play with each other rather than wait for
            each other to end before playing. However, there is no currently existing loop
            functionality to allow the user to create a track. This application simply
            plays the sound track for each "key" in real time.
